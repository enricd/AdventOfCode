## My solutions of the Advent of Code challenge 

### ----- 2021 -----
In this repo I upload my solutions of the [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com), by the moment I try to keep it on time solving every day's challenge in less than 24h from its release in Python on Jupyter Notebooks.

The code probably isn't the most clean and optimal solution but almost my first valid approach.
