## My solutions of the Advent of Code challenge 

### ----- 2021 -----
In this repo I upload my solutions of the [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com), by the moment I try to keep it on time solving every day's challenge in less than 24h from its release in Python on Jupyter Notebooks. (UPDATE: I lost my <24h streak on day 15 for the 2nd part, even so, I'm still trying to solve them and reengage with the current day's challenge).

The code probably isn't the most clean and optimal solution but almost my first valid approach.
